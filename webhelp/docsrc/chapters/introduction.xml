  programmers interface to MariaDB. It contains a collection of functions that
  allow client programs to send statements to the MariaDB server and to receive
  data of these statements.

  The MariaDB client library is licensed under the LGPL License Version 2. It's
  derived from the MySQL 3.23.58 client library and PHP's mysqlnd extension. It
  is fully binary compatible to MySQL client library, so it's possible to
  communicate with database servers from other vendors. Since the MariaDB server
  offers more functionality not all functions might be supported by databases
  from other vendors.
