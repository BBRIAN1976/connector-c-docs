    Function reference

  <para>
    Here is a list of all functions in the non-blocking client API and their parameters. Apart from operating in a non-blocking way, they all work exactly the same as their non-blocking counterparts, so their exact semantics can be obtained from the documentation of the normal client API.
  </para>
  <para>
    Not all functions are supported by all packages. Please refer to the version
    information inside the function reference to check if the function is
    supported. Some functionality like experimental features are disabled by
    default and can be activated by build switches.
