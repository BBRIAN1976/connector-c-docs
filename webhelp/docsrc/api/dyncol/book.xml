    Dynamic column API
  </title>
  <para>
    Dynamic columns allows one to store different sets of columns for each row in
    a table. It works by storing a set of columns in a blob and having a small set
    of functions to manipulate it.

    Dynamic columns should be used when it is not possible to use regular columns.

  <para>
    A typical use case is when one needs to store items that may have many
    different attributes (like size, color, weight, etc), and the set of possible
    attributes is very large and/or unknown in advance. In that case, attributes
    can be put into dynamic columns.
